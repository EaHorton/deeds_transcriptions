# Hybrid OCR + AI Correction Requirements
# This file contains Python packages needed for the hybrid OCR script (hybrid_ocr_ai.py)
# that combines Tesseract OCR with OpenAI's text correction capabilities

# Traditional OCR functionality
pytesseract>=0.3.10

# OpenAI API for text correction
openai>=1.0.0

# Image processing and manipulation
Pillow>=10.0.0

# Additional packages that may be useful for image preprocessing
# Uncomment if needed for advanced image processing
# opencv-python>=4.8.0
# numpy>=1.24.0

# System Requirements:
# 1. Tesseract OCR binary must be installed:
#    - macOS: brew install tesseract
#    - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
#    - Windows: Download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
#
# 2. OpenAI API key required:
#    - Sign up at https://platform.openai.com/
#    - Create an API key in your dashboard
#    - Set environment variable: export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
#
# To install these requirements:
# pip install -r requirements_ocr_ai.txt
#
# Estimated costs (as of 2024 - verify current rates):
# - GPT-4o-mini: $0.00015 per 1K input tokens, $0.0006 per 1K output tokens
# - GPT-4o: $0.005 per 1K input tokens, $0.015 per 1K output tokens
# - Typical cost per image correction: $0.001 - $0.01 USD (much cheaper than full AI vision)
#
# Benefits of this hybrid approach:
# - Fast initial extraction with Tesseract
# - Intelligent error correction with AI
# - Lower cost than pure AI vision approach
# - Better accuracy than pure Tesseract OCR
# - Preserves historical context and meaning
