# OCR Processing Requirements
# This file contains all the Python packages needed to run the OCR processor scripts

# Traditional OCR functionality (for ocr_processor.py)
pytesseract>=0.3.10

# AI Vision OCR functionality (for ai_vision_ocr.py)
openai>=1.0.0

# Image processing (used by both scripts)
Pillow>=10.0.0

# Additional packages that may be useful for image preprocessing
# Uncomment if needed for advanced image processing
# opencv-python>=4.8.0
# numpy>=1.24.0

# Notes:
# For traditional OCR (ocr_processor.py), you also need Tesseract OCR binary:
# - macOS: brew install tesseract
# - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
# - Windows: Download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
#
# For AI Vision OCR (ai_vision_ocr.py), you need an OpenAI API key:
# - Sign up at https://platform.openai.com/
# - Set environment variable: export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
